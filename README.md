# Python-for-Mechanical-Engineering-Exercises
In an effort to get back into coding and understanding Python for engineering modeling applications, I ran through the exercises in https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373862358_Python_Programming_for_Mechanical_Engineers. Most of the solutions are laid out in the book, but it helped to confirm my base understanding.

I ran through exercises for:
- Air resistance while biking
- Motion of a 2-link robotic arm
- Otto cycle
- Damped Pendulum motion
